The script asks the user for the IP address, username, list of passwords, domain, and rate limit for password attempts. It then loops through the list of passwords and attempts to login using the specified IP address, username, password, and domain. If the login is successful, the script prints a success message and breaks out of the loop. If the login fails, the script records the last attempt time and waits for the specified rate limit before attempting the next password. The last attempt time is stored in a text file called "last_attempt.txt".
